MERN-STACK

MERN Stack comprises of 4 technologies namely: MongoDB, Express, React and Node.js. It is designed to make the development process smoother and easier. Each of these technologies provides an end-to-end framework for the developers to work in and help in development of web applications.

1. MongoDB : Cross-platform Document-Oriented Database

MongoDB is a NoSQL database where each record is a document comprising of key-value pairs. MongoDB is flexible and allows its users to create schema, databases, tables. Once MongoDB is installed, users can make use of Mongo shell. Mongo shell provides a JavaScript interface through which the users can interact and carry out operations (eg: querying, updating records, deleting records).

Advantages of MongoDB:

i) Fast – Being a document-oriented database, easy to index documents. Therefore a faster response.

ii) Scalability – Large data can be handled by dividing it into several machines.

iii) Use of JavaScript – MongoDB uses JavaScript which is the biggest advantage.

iv) Schema Less – Any type of data in a separate document.

v) Simple Environment Setup – Its really simple to set up MongoDB.

vi) Flexible Document Model – MongoDB supports document-model(tables, schemas, coloumns & SQL) which is faster and easier.

2. Express : Back-End Framework

Express is a Node.js framework. Rather than writing the code using Node.js and creating loads of Node modules, Express makes it simpler and easier to write the back-end code. Express helps in designing great web applications and APIs.

Advantages of Express : 

i) Asynchronous and Single-threaded.

ii) Effecient, fast & scalable.

iii) Has the biggest community for Node.js.

iv) Express promotes code reusability with its built-in router.

v) Robust API.

vi)Create a new folder to start your express project and type below command in the command prompt to initialize a package.json file. Accept the default settings and continue. 

3. React : Front-End Library

React is a JavaScript library that is used for building user interfaces. React is used for the development of single-page applications and mobile applications because of its ability to handle rapidly changing data. React allows users to code in JavasScript and create UI components.

Advantages of React :

i) Virtual DOM – A virtual DOM object is a representation of a DOM object. Virtual DOM is actually a copy of the original DOM. Any modification in the web application causes the entire UI to re-render the virtual DOM. Then the difference between the original DOM and this virtual DOM is compared and the changes are made accordingly to the original DOM.

ii) JSX – Stands for JavaScript XML. It is an HTML/XML JavaScript Extension which is used in React. Makes it easier and simpler to write React components.

iii) Components – ReactJS supports Components. Components are the building blocks of UI wherein each component has a logic and contributes to the overall UI. These components also promote code reusability and make the overall web application easier to understand.

iv) High Performance – Features like Virtual DOM, JSX and Components makes it much faster than the rest of the frameworks out there.

v) Developing Android/Ios Apps – With React Native you can easily code Android-based or IOS-Based apps with just the knowledge of JavaScript and ReactJS.

4. Node.js: JS Runtime Environment 

Node.js provides a JavaScript Environment which allows the user to run their code on the server (outside the browser). Node pack manager i.e. npm allows the user to choose from thousands of free packages (node modules) to download. 

Advantages of Node.js:

i) Open source JavaScript Runtime Environemnt.

ii) Single threading – Follows a single threaded model.

iii) Data Streaming.

iv) Fast – Built on Google Chrome’s JavaScript Engine, Node.js has a fast code execution.

v) Highly Scalable.
